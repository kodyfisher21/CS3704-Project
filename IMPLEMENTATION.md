Implementation Log

Kody Fisher
What was implemented:
Updated the main class to match the student class and it's class schedule parameters. Ask the user for input on their name, class taken, day taken, and time taken. Compare this with a random list of students and their random schedules in order to test if the user matches with one of them.

How it was implementated:
Used pair programming with Jay as we worked together to update the student class and main class to match parameters and structure. This allowed us to collaboratively figure out a base structure for our system and have a simple, but understandable design.

How it relates to overall system design:
This relates to our low level design of the behavioral design pattern family. This is because we had a chain of responsibility between group members and what they were to implement for the beginning of this design. I made updates to the implementation and base design in order for our main class and student class to work together.

Jay Foti
What was implemented:
I implemented the revised Student class that contains the student name and schedule. The schedule is in the form of a 2-D array, with one set representing the hours and the other representing the days. Because the schedule is being stored in Student, I deleted the other student schedule class because it was unneeded. 
How it was implementated:
I used pair programming with Kody to update both Student and main so the program was somewhat functional and made sense. We gave feedback to each other to improve our code.
How it relates to overall system design:
This relates to the overall system design because we are using a chain of responsiblity design amongst our group to determine who will implement what functionality/aspect of our program.
