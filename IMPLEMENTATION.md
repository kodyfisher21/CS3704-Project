Implementation Log

Kody Fisher
What was implemented:
Updated the main class to match the student class and it's class schedule parameters. Ask the user for input on their name, class taken, day taken, and time taken. Compare this with a random list of students and their random schedules in order to test if the user matches with one of them.

How it was implementated:
Used pair programming with Jay as we worked together to update the student class and main class to match parameters and structure. This allowed us to collaboratively figure out a base structure for our system and have a simple, but understandable design.

How it relates to overall system design:
This relates to our low level design of the behavioral design pattern family. This is because we had a chain of responsibility between group members and what they were to implement for the beginning of this design. I made updates to the implementation and base design in order for our main class and student class to work together.
